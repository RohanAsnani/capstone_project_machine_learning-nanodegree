# capstone_project_machine_learning-nanodegree

Description
Take any directory full of stuff that you're working on; web apps, scripts, Jupyter notebooks, data files, whatever it may be.
By adding an anaconda-project.yml to this project directory, a single anaconda-project runcommand will be able to set up all dependencies and then launch the project.
Anaconda projects should run in the same way on your machine, on a colleague's machine, or when deployed to a server.
Running an Anaconda project executes a command specified in the anaconda-project.yml (any arbitrary commands can be configured).
anaconda-project.yml automates project setup; Anaconda can establish all prerequisite conditions for the project's commands to execute successfully. These conditions could include:
•	creating a conda environment with certain packages in it
•	prompting the user for passwords or other configuration
•	downloading data files
•	starting extra processes such as a database server
The goal is that if your project runs on your machine, it will also run on others' machines (or on your future machine after you reboot a few times and forget how your project works).
The command anaconda-project init DIRECTORY_NAME creates an anaconda-project.yml, converting your project directory into an Anaconda project.
Put another way...
Traditional build scripts such as setup.py automate "building" the project (going from source code to something runnable), while anaconda-project automates "running" the project (taking build artifacts and doing any necessary setup prior to executing them).
